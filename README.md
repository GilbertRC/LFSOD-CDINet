# LFSOD-CDINet
This project provides the code and results for 'Light Field Salient Object Detection with Sparse Views via Complementary and Discriminative Interaction Network', IEEE TCSVT, accepted, 2023. [paper link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10168184)

The code will come in soon.

# Requirements
python 3.7 + TensorFlow 1.14.0

# Saliency maps and performance

We provide [results](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1OSDsj9FCLZHMiTSGCPQ1Ww) (code: lau2) of our CDINet on 3 datasets (HFUT-Lytro Illum, HFUT-Lytro and DUTLF-V2)
